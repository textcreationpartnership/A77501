         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Let it then be concluded as a truth clearly and convincingly held forth by this Text, that <hi>whole Chriſt,</hi> Chriſt <hi>God and Man,</hi> is the Gift here ſpoken of. <hi>[The great God, even our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Ieſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf.]</hi>

                  <p>And in this way did Chriſt give <hi>himſelf</hi> for us <gap reason="foreign">

Thus our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> ſpeaking to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> Joh. 6.51. tels them, <hi>The bread which I will give is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. we are ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified through the offering of the Body of Chriſt;</hi> Not by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it in heaven (as <hi>Grotius</hi> would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it,) but offering it upon earth, upon the Altar of the Croſſe. Which Texts (and the like) we are to underſtand <hi>Synecdochically;</hi> Not that only the <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt was intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe his ſufferings, but his <hi>ſoul</hi> alſo. So it was <hi>before his Paſſion,</hi> having divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, ſpecially with the apprehenſion of that death which he was to undergo. <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled,</hi> (ſaith he to his Diſciples, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.27.) <hi>and what ſhall I ſay?

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170465:31"/> from this hour.</hi> And ſo again in the <hi>Garden</hi> he complaineth in the like manner to ſome of them, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death,</hi> Matth. 26.38.

Thus was his ſoul alſo made a partner in this ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as the Prophet <hi>Iſai</hi> expreſſeth it) in the three laſt verſes of his 53.

And in ſuch a ſenſe may he fitly here be ſaid to be <hi>the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole world,</hi> in as much as all who are reconciled unto God, they receive that benefit by and through him, and no other. Thus (to make uſe of a plain Illuſtration) he who was the firſt <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of ſome <hi>Invention</hi> (as of <hi>Printing</hi> or <hi>Guns,</hi>) may be ſaid to have <hi>taught the whole world</hi> that Art; not that every man in the world hath learned it from him, but that all who have learned it, they are beholding to him for it.

                  <p>In the latter ſenſe underſtand we the word in that other Text.<note place="margin">Indefinitely, for all ſorts and kinds of men.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſome for all;</hi>] that is, <hi>All kinds</hi> and ſorts of men.

So much is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly collected from the verſes there fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, where the Apoſtle exhorts that <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Interceſſions, &amp; giving of thanks be made for all men;</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. That there are ſome,<note place="margin">1. Not Heathens who never heard of Chriſt.</note> yea the greateſt part of the world, who never heard of the name of Chriſt.

But that all ſhould believe that theſe benefits of Chriſts death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto them, we find no where injoyned. Nay, for ſome to believe this, <hi>viz.</hi> wicked and ungodly perſons, continuing in their ſins, and reſolving ſo to do, it were no other but a groundleſſe preſumption, a thing which they have no warrant to do. As for ſuch let it be ſaid to them, as <hi>Iehu</hi> once ſpake to <hi>Ioram,</hi> when he enquired of him concerning Peace, <hi>Is it Peace Iehu? What haſt thou to do with Peace</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo long as the whordoms of thy Mother Iezabel, and her witchcrafts are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</hi> 2 King. 9.22. So ſay I concerning this <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> the <hi>Lord Ieſus,</hi> who hath ſhed his blood to make peace betwixt God &amp; man, what have you to do with him, or with his blood, to lay any claim to the merit of his death, to believe that this blood was ſhed for you, whileſt you thus trample it under your feet by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170465:55"/> your continuing &amp; going on in your ſinful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations? So then, all are not bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, that Chriſt dyed for them. Not they who thus daily <hi>crucifie him afreſh</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6.) Nay thus conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in their impenitency, they are rather bound to believe the contrary, that Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended to ſpend any drop of his blood for them, that any benefit of his death ſhould redound unto them, and ſo that he dyed not for them. Thus to apply the death of Chriſt, and bring it home to a mans ſelf, is a thing which is peculiar to ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>broken-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, humbled ſinners.</hi> Such Chriſt calleth to come unto him. <hi>Come unto me ye that labour and are heavy laden.</hi> For ſuch it was <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf,</hi> whereof they may reſt aſſured; Not ſo others.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Chriſt offered to all for the Elects ſake.</note>For the former, firſt Chriſt is thus offered unto all for the <hi>Elects</hi> ſake. Thus many things are done in the world, and in the Church, for their ſakes. For their ſakes it is that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is Preached. For their ſakes it is that God ſends forth his <hi>Miniſters.</hi> Even as at the laſt day he ſhall <hi>ſend forth his Angels, to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether his Elect from the four winds, from one end of the heaven to the other,</hi> Matth. 24.31. So to bring them into his Kingdom of <hi>Glory:</hi> even ſo now he ſendeth forth his Miniſters, the <hi>Angels of the Churches,</hi> to gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Elect,</hi> to gather them out of the world, and to bring them into his Kingdom of <hi>Grace:</hi> So as, were it not for their ſakes, the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould not be ſent forth, neither ſhould the Goſpel be Preached at all. This was the Reaſon which the Lord giveth unto his Servant <hi>Paul,</hi> why he would have him abide at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and Preach the Goſpel there, <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) I <hi>have much people in that City,</hi> many who belonged to his Election of grace, whom he intended to bring home, effectually to call by his Miniſtery, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.10. intimating, that had it not been for their ſakes, <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould not have Preached there. And upon this ground it was that <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170465:56"/> both did, and ſuffered, what he did. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I endure all things for the Elects ſake, that they may alſo obtein the Salvation which is in Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> (ſo he tels <hi>Timothy,</hi>) 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. And for their ſakes it is, that in the Preaching of the Goſpel Chriſt is offered unto <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>every one.</hi> In as much as the <hi>Election of God is ſecret,</hi> known only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. Not ſo to others, not to <hi>Man.</hi> And therefore is it that the Miniſters of Chriſt muſt <hi>Preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> as their Commiſſion runs, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. Offering Chriſt to all, and every man, that ſo Gods <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> may be gathered out of all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To which might be added,<note place="margin">2: That others may be left without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</note> this is done alſo for the ſake of others, that <hi>they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not may be left without excuſe.

Chriſt coming and Preaching of the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and ſo tendering himſelf to them, rendered them inexcuſable. And ſo doth the Preaching of the Goſpel, and the offering of Chriſt to thoſe that reject him, will not believe on him, it leaves them without any <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>If Chriſt dyed for all alike,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>For ſuch was that love which he ſhewed in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170465:67"/> thus giving himſelf. So he himſelf looked upon it. <hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that one lay down his life for his friends,</hi> ſo he tells his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> whom he calleth his <hi>friends,</hi> Joh. 15.13. A higher expreſſion of love there cannot be than this, for one to dye for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                     </gap>, a ſurety for the other, to dye for him in caſe he returned not. So then, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> thus became a ſurety for all, dying alike for them, then muſt he bear and expreſs a like love to all. As much to <hi>Iudas,</hi> as to <hi>Peter;</hi> as much to the <hi>damned in Hell,</hi> as to the <hi>Saints in Heaven.</hi> An Argument, which, whatever Evaſions are ſought out for to elude it, will never be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> As for that which by way of Reply is told us, that Chriſts <hi>beſtowing</hi> of Salvation is an act of greater love than his <hi>meriting</hi> of it,<note place="margin">Chriſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of Salvation not an act of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter love than his meriting it.</note> As it is directly contrary to what our Saviour himſelf there affirmed, and to the truth it ſelf, there being greater love ſhewn in ſuffering much for the obteining of a thing for one, than in conferring it upon him afterwards; So it maketh nothing to the purpoſe intended, in as much as theſe two cannot be ſevered, the <hi>meriting</hi> and <hi>beſtowing</hi> of Salvation.<note place="margin">Meriting and conferring not to be ſevered.</note> Thoſe for whom Chriſt hath obteined it by his death, he will actually eſtate them in it. <hi>If when we were enemies we were reconciled unto God by the death of his Son, much more being

                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> Neither will that diſtinction, which is here made uſe of, ought avail, <hi>viz.</hi> of an <hi>Antecedent</hi> and <hi>Conſequent</hi> love;<note place="margin">Chriſts Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent and Conſequent love.</note> a love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt loveth men before they believe, and after, The former of which is ſaid to be alike unto all, but not ſo the latter, in as much as ſtill that <hi>Antecedent love</hi> (as they call it,) that love which Chriſt ſhewed unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in dying for them, and ſo purchaſing Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for them, is the greateſt act of love.<note place="margin">Chriſts dying for his people the greateſt act of love.</note> So the Apoſtle looked upon it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 9. where comparing theſe two together, that love which goeth before <hi>Iuſtification</hi> with that which followeth after, maketh the former of theſe the greater. <hi>God commendeth his love towards us</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>that his love,</hi> his tranſcendent and ſurpaſſing love) <hi>in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt dyed for us. Much more then being juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him.</hi> This was the higheſt demonſtration of love, that ever God ſhewed to the Sons of men, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his <hi>Son to dye</hi> for them; and ſo of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in thus giving himſelf for them. Neither are theſe two <hi>diſtinct kinds</hi> of love in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Chriſts Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent and Conſequent love the ſame Love.</note> to be willing to ſave before, and after faith. But they are onely two effects and iſſues of one and the ſame love, which (as I ſaid) manifeſts it ſelf more in the former of theſe, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ground of the latter. So as ſtill the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument holdeth firm. If Chriſt dyed alike for all, then did he bear and expreſs alike love to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170465:68"/> all, which how derogatory it is to that love which he bare to his Elect, I ſhall God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) ſhew you afterward. To this adde but one more.</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt dyed alike for all, then why is not this <hi>alike made known to all?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. Chriſt not made known to all, but to a few.</note> that they might take notice of what is done for them. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the blood of Chriſt may ſeem to be ſpilt in vain as to theſe who never heard of him, who are hereby made altogether uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving any benefit from him, in as much as they are not capable of believing on him. <hi>How ſhall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? Rom.</hi> 10. But this is a ſecret, made known but to a few. So it was <hi>before the coming</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>A myſtery that was hidden from ages and generations</hi> (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith of it) <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. <hi>A myſtery which from the beginning of the world was hid in God</hi> (as elſewhere he hath it) <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. A ſecret hid in Gods own breaſt and boſome, made known but to a few. And ſo it is ſtill in a great meaſure <hi>ſince the coming</hi> of Chriſt, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many parts of the world, yea the greateſt part of it, which ſcarſe ever heard of the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> which that it is done by a divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſo diſpoſing of it, is a thing not to be queſtioned. Now if Chriſt dyed alike for all, and ſo merited Salvation alike for all, why then is this kept ſecret from ſo many? If Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation were alike purchaſed by him for all men, why is not this declared and publiſhed, that all thoſe who <hi>will</hi> (to ſpeak in their language) might take the benefit of it?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170465:68"/> Why is this <hi>grace of God</hi> hidden from ſo many, to whom it belongeth as well as others? and without the knowledge of which there is no poſſibility of their Salvation?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> To this it is replyed, This grace is not alike held forth to all, becauſe many ſhew themſelves <hi>unworthy</hi> of it.<note place="margin">

The Lord ſending his Prophet <hi>Exekiel</hi> to the people of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> he tells him afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, what ones he ſhould find them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Son of man, I ſend thee to the Children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, to a rebellious Nation.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>They are impudent Children, and ſtif-hearted, I do ſend thee unto them, and thou ſhalt ſay unto them, Thus ſaith the Lord God.

Sometimes, yea oftimes, <hi>where ſin aboundeth grace ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth,</hi> Rom. 5.20. There muſt then be ſome higher cauſe which putteth this difference betwixt Nation, and Nation. And what ſhall that be? Surely where God hath a <hi>people</hi> that do belong unto his Election of grace, he will reveal and make known his Son to them ſome way or other. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt continue preaching the Goſpel at <hi>Corinth,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Lord had

This I ſhall (God willing) ſpeak to ſomewhat more fully hereafter. Where I ſhall ſhew you that there is more true ſolid comfort to be found in the other, the <hi>old way,</hi> than in this.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170465:71"/> Which take in three or four particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is a Doctrine which <hi>derogates much from the Grace of God,</hi> in giving his Son.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It derogates from the love of God the Father in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Son.</note> So in truth it doth; However it is vulgarly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe looked upon, as a Doctrine that doth elevate and magnifie this grace far more than the other, and that by extending and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of it, yet really it extenuates it, and derogates much from it, whileſt it aſſerts it to be alike extended to, and intended for all. Which if ſo, where is then that <hi>ſpecial,</hi> that <hi>ſingular</hi> love of God to his <hi>Elect,</hi> which is every where ſo highly extolled in Scripture? In compariſon of which that <hi>love</hi> which he beareth to others is little better than hatred. And therefore ſo called by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Iacob have I loved, Eſau have I hated;</hi> that is, not loved the one with the like love that I did the other. Certainly, whatever may be conceived of it, to make Gods intention in giving his Son to be alike towards all, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates not a little from that <hi>great love</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he loved his <hi>Elect</hi> people, which far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth that love which he bare to the reſt of Man-kind.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2: It derogates from the love of God the Son in giving himſelf.</note> Which certainly towards his <hi>Church,</hi> his <hi>Body,</hi> was a peculiar, and tranſcendent love. Thence is it that the Apoſtle compares it with the love of a <hi>Husband</hi> to his <hi>Wife, Eph.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Husbands love your wives even as Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it.</hi> Now that love which <hi>Husbands</hi> bear and ſhew to their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170465:71"/> 
                     <hi>wives</hi> is, (or ought to be,) greater than that which they bear and ſhew to any others. <hi>For this cauſe ſhall a man leave his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cleave unto his wife,</hi> Matth. 19.5. There being the <hi>neereſt relation</hi> betwixt them, there ought alſo to be the <hi>deareſt affection.</hi> And ſo was it betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Elect,</hi> there being a nearer Relation betwixt him and them than any other, they being <hi>given to him by his Father;</hi> and made one with him, he bare a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and peculiar love to them. <hi>As the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath loved me ſo have I loved loved you</hi> (ſaith he to his Diſciples) <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.9. Now what <hi>love</hi> like that which God the Father bare unto his Son Chriſt? who is therefore called, <hi>The beloved,</hi> Eph. 1.6. and Gods <hi>beloved Son,</hi> Matth. 3.17. And ſuch was that <hi>love</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhewed to his <hi>Elect</hi> people in giving himſelf for them. <hi>Who loved us and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us,</hi> Eph. 5.2. Certainly, to make the love of Chriſt alike unto all, is no ſmall dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from that love which he bare to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. And this do they who will have him to give himſelf alike for all, in dying for them. Which was (as I have ſhewn you) the greateſt act and higheſt expreſſion of love that ever Chriſt ſhewed to any.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Doctrine as it <hi>derogates</hi> much from <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt, ſo it <hi>arrogates</hi> too much unto <hi>Man,</hi> in as much as it <hi>layeth the ground of his differing from others in himſelf.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. It arrogates too much unto Man, laying the ground of his differing from others in himſelf.</note> For ſo it runs. As for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> what he hath done he hath done it alike for all. How is it then that ſome are ſaved by him, others not? What is it
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170465:72"/> that maketh one to <hi>differ</hi> from another? Why only becauſe the one receiveth what the other rejecteth. So as by this Doctrine it muſt be left meerly to the liberty of mans own will to difference and diſtinguiſh himſelf from others. Which runs directly croſs to that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>For who maketh thee to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from another? And what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> Yea (but (it will be ſaid) this is from the <hi>grace</hi> of God that any one cometh thus to receive what is offered, to apply what is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, to believe on Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Faith a fruit not of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace.</note>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> But what Grace is this, which they ſpeak of? Not any <hi>ſpecial</hi> grace which Chriſt merited or intended for one more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but a <hi>common</hi> grace, ſuch as is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently reached forth to all, to whom the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is preached. Now how is it that this Grace is <hi>effectual</hi> to one, not to another? Why this is not any thing that Chriſt hath done, or intended more for the one than the other; not that he hath <hi>merited faith</hi> for them, that they ſhould believe rather than others, but meerly from the liberty of their own will. So as the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of the death of Chriſt is by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in the ultimate reſolution of it, made wholy to depend upon the will of man. A <hi>Coar</hi> which will ſtick in the throats of who ever they are that ſhall ſwallow this Doctrine <hi>of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Redemption</hi> in ſuch a ſenſe as it is vulgarly held forth; a <hi>Conſequence</hi> which they will never be able to free it, or themſelves from. Which I deſire that it may be taken
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170465:72"/> ſpecial notice of, that ſo it may appear, that it is not without juſt and weighty Reaſon that we are ſo averſe unto this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which draweth ſuch a train after it, upon which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch mewtable inconveniences. A Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which <hi>derogates</hi> ſo much from <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt, and <hi>arrogates</hi> too much to a mans ſelf. Both which Chriſtians ought to be very wary of.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To this might be added (what alſo is conſiderable) that this <hi>Doctrine breaks in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that Golden Chain of Salvation.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4. It breaketh in pieces the Golden Chain of Salvation.</note> The firſt <hi>Link</hi> whereof <hi>(Election,)</hi> if it be not hereby wholy broken of, yet is it diſordered, made to come after <hi>Redemption.</hi> For ſo it runs. God did firſt intend to give his Son for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming and ſaving ſome among mankind, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which ſhould believe on him. And then foreſeeing who they were that would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and perſevere in ſo doing, he chuſe them unto Salvation. Which how doth it pervert that <hi>Order</hi> which Scripture holdeth forth in the <hi>Cauſes of mans Salvation,</hi> the firſt whereof is <hi>Election. Whom he did prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate them he alſo called,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. God firſt chooſeth ſome out of mankind, whom predeſtinating and appointing unto eternal life, he giveth unto his Son Chriſt (<hi>All that the father giveth me ſhall come unto me,</hi> Joh. 6.7.) that he might execute that his gracious purpoſe concerning them. Which accordingly he doth by <hi>Redeeming, Iuſtifying, Sanctifying, Saving</hi> of them. Now this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt and great <hi>wheel,</hi> which ſets all the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170465:73"/> reſt a rank, if this be diſordered (as by this Doctrine it is) it muſt needs breed a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous confuſion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And again this <hi>Doctrine</hi> (what ever may be conceived of it) is not a little prejudicial to the <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> of a Believer;<note place="margin">5.

This being all (according to this Doctrine) that Chriſt hath merited for him, that upon his believing and perſevering he ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, not that he ſhall believe and perſevere unto Salvation. So as however he be in a ſtate of grace for the preſent, yet he may fall away totally and finally, and ſo periſh for ever, as Millions of others have done, for whom yet Chriſt dyed as well as for himſelf. And if ſo, where then is <hi>Pauls Triumph,</hi> which he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that forecited Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that dyed.</hi>

And how he was ſent by his <hi>Father</hi> upon this arrand, for the Redeeming and ſaving of loſt Man-kind. Without this knowledge and belief, you are not capable of receiving any benefit by the death of Chriſt. This is is a Character which Chriſt giveth of his <hi>ſheep;</hi> thoſe for whom he ſaith he gave himſelf, in that Text forenamed, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.14. I <hi>know my ſheep, and am known of mine.</hi> They are ſuch as know and believe him

And thus muſt they be in meaſure qualified, who ever expect any benefit from the death of Chriſt. They muſt be ſuch as know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Doctrine of the Goſpel. <hi>Repent ye, and believe the Goſpel,</hi> (ſo our Saviour begins his preaching) <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.15.

And it muſt needs be ſo; Being all <hi>dead in ſin</hi> (as the ſame Apoſtle ſets forth mans natural ſtate, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. and elſewhere.) Now what can a dead man do for the raiſing up of himſelf? No more can a poor ſinner do for the freeing of himſelf from that wretched, accurſed ſtate and condition wherein he is by reaſon of ſin. So as there is an abſolute neceſſity of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

No hope in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of obteining reconciliation with God. Now this thy condition being ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, as that there is but this one way left to ſave thee, what ſhould hinder thee from put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy ſoul upon this way?

Thus ſtandeth the caſe, all men by nature are in a <hi>ſhipwrackt condition,</hi> all plunged into a Sea of miſery by reaſon of ſin, all in a periſhing ſtate, ready every moment of time to ſink into the bottom of hell. Now loe, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is caſt forth as ſuch a <hi>Plank,</hi> to ſuch an end. <hi>Him hath God ſet forth to be a Propitiation through faith in his blood,</hi> Rom. 3.25. And other way or means of ſalvation there is none. What then ſhould hinder poor ſinners, who ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this condition, to put themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this way? Not ſtanding to reaſon whether
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170465:79"/> this Plank was caſt forth for them; whether Chriſt was given for them, and whether they ſhall be ſure to be ſaved by him; but to take hold of him, caſting themſelves upon him; as knowing that if this way ſave them not, they muſt periſh, and that for ever. Such adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures men often make in deſperate caſes, they put themſelves upon any wayes which may give them any hopes of ſuccour. And ſuch is the caſe here. Poor ſinners are in a deſperate condition, as to whatever themſelves, or any Creature, whether Man or Angel, is able to do for them. Onely in this way, it cannot be denyed, there is hope for them. And why then ſhould they not put themſelves upon the adventure? It was the incouragement, which <hi>Shecaniah</hi> gave unto <hi>Ezra</hi> to ſet upon a work of Reformation among the people, for the diverting of Gods judgements from them, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.2. <hi>We have treſpaſſed againſt the Lord</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>yet now there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing.</hi> And ſo upon the like ground it is that the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> exhorts the people to turn unto God by Repentance, <hi>For who knoweth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if he will return, and repent, and leave a bleſſing behind him?</hi> Joel. 2.13, 14. They were not ſure that upon their Reformation and Repentance the Lord would preſently free them from thoſe temporal judgements, which then lay upon them. Yet knowing that there was no other way for the obteining of ſuch a mercy, but this, and that there was hope in this way, therefore they will have them put themſelves upon it. So
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170465:79"/> ſtandeth it with all poor ſinners; be their ſtate and condition whatever it will be, yet <hi>there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing.</hi> God hath provided a means of Salvation for ſuch as they are. And who knoweth but that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, upon their coming to his Son Chriſt, to apply it unto them? So as were there nothing elſe, yet this alone ſhould be ſufficient to put poor ſinners upon this way of coming unto Chriſt, and believing on him.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170465:80"/> being the ſuffering of an infinite perſon. Thus was it <hi>ſufficient for all men,</hi> for the whole world, yea for thouſands of worlds.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170465:80"/> ſtung to repair unto it. Thus ſtandeth the caſe here. For ſuch an end was the Lord <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> (of whom that was a <hi>Type) lifted up upon the Croſs, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not perſh, but have eternal life</hi> (as our Saviour himſelf explains the myſtery of it) <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.14, 15. And of the vertue of this <hi>myſtical Brazen Serpent</hi> the Saints in all ages have had experience. Thoſe <hi>before</hi> Chriſt, <hi>after.</hi> The one looking upon him as to come, the other as already come, Yet believing on him they were all ſaved by him. Even as the Iſraelites which looked upon that <hi>Serpent,</hi> whether it was before, or behind, or on which ſide ſoever, we do not find but they were all cured. Thus have the Ages before Chriſt &amp; ſince, the Fathers under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Saints under the New, both alike found benefit by coming unto Chriſt, and looking up unto him by faith. <hi>We believe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) that through the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt we ſhall be ſaved, even as they,</hi> Act. 15.11.

Even as it was with the <hi>Maides</hi> which were to go in to King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> to bed with him, they were firſt to be <hi>purified</hi> for a certain time, for <hi>twelve moneths</hi> together; which was to be done with Myrrh and other ſweet Odours (as we may read the manner of it, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 2.12.)

In cauſâ Dei meminem patientem eſſe oportet.</hi> For Men to be patient in Gods cauſe; where his honour lyeth at the ſtake; it is no other than an irreligious ſtupidity.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> For the explicating of the Phraſe, we may take notice of a two-fold <hi>coming</hi> unto Chriſt (even as there is a two-fold <hi>Calling</hi>) the one <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>formal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A two-fold coming to Chriſt.</note> the other <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>real.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is an <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>formal coming</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Outward and formal.</note> unto Chriſt, which is common to all that make a profeſſion of his name. Thus do <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>formal Profeſſors</hi> come unto him, who being led and drawn by ſome ſiniſter reſpects, hold forth this profeſſion. Thus did theſe <hi>Capernaites</hi> here come unto Chriſt, they flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, and followed after him. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was it? Not out of any true reſpect they had to his <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but for ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantage which they expected from him, <hi>viz.</hi> that they might be fed by him. So he himſelf, who knew their thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170465:184"/> chargeth it upon them, <hi>v.</hi> 26. of this Chapter <hi>[Ye ſeek me not becauſe ye ſaw the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but becauſe ye did eat of the loaves.]</hi> It was not his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>works,</hi> that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, but their own bellies. And in ſuch a way there are many that <hi>come</hi> unto Chriſt, who were never <hi>given</hi> to him by his Father; even all <hi>Carnal Gospellers,</hi> who profeſt themſelves the followers of Jeſus Chriſt, take upon them the profeſſion of his name, but it is not out of any true inward reſpects which they have unto him, but out of ſome by and ſiniſter ends for their own <hi>Credit</hi> or <hi>Profit,</hi> or for <hi>faſhion</hi>-ſake. Such <hi>followers</hi> Chriſt had many in the dayes of his fleſh. And many ſuch he hath wherever he cometh, wherever his Goſpel is preached. But let we theſe go as they come; not owned by God before they come, nor any more owned for this their coming.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place there is a coming to Chriſt, which is <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Real.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2.

Thus did ſome of his followers, his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> at this time come unto him, looking upon him as the <hi>bread of life.</hi> And thus do all true <hi>Believers</hi> come unto him, who come to him as a <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> and a <hi>Lord,</hi> receiving him, believing on him. This is the coming of which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our here ſpeaketh in the Text. <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come unto me]</hi> that is,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170465:184"/> 
                     <hi>Believe on me.</hi> So the 35th verſe explaines it.<note place="margin">Coming to Chriſt, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on him.</note> 
                     <hi>He that cometh unto me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt;]</hi> where the latter word is <hi>Exegetical</hi> and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory to the former.

This it is to <hi>believe</hi> on Chriſt, and this it is to <hi>come</hi> unto him.</p>
                  <p>A Metaphorical expreſſion, fitly ſetting forth the nature of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſaving, juſtifying Faith.<note place="margin">Faith, the coming of the ſoul unto Chriſt.</note> Which is (as I ſaid) <hi>A coming of the ſoul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt.</hi> Even as thoſe Patients of his of whom we read in the Goſpel, feeling their own infirmities, and hearing of his fame, and expecting to partake of the like benefit from him that others had done, they come unto him, caſting themſelves down at his feet, imploring his aid, ſome of them touching him, as that <hi>Haemorrhoiſſe,</hi> that woman with the bloody iſſue is ſaid to have done, who coming behind him touched the hem of his garment (which ſhe did, as with her <hi>finger,</hi> ſo with her <hi>faith</hi>) by which meanes ſhe drew from him that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native vertue by which ſhe was healed, <hi>Mat.</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:170465:185"/> 9.20. Even thus doth the ſoul <hi>come unto Chriſt</hi> by <hi>faith;</hi> being made ſenſible of its own wretched condition by reaſon of ſin, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the <hi>fulneſſe</hi> that is in Chriſt, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Merit,</hi> and fulneſs of <hi>Spirit,</hi> whereby he is able to work a perfect <hi>cure</hi> for it, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away both the <hi>guilt</hi> and power of ſin, and procuring <hi>eternal ſalvation</hi> for it, now, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all other confidences, it betaketh it ſelf unto him as to an alone all-ſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, laying hold upon him, reſting upon him, that ſo it may be made partaker of his <hi>Merits,</hi> his Benefits. This it is to <hi>come unto Chriſt,</hi> thus to <hi>believe</hi> on him.</p>
                  <p>And thus do they <hi>come unto him who are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him by his Father.</hi> They, <hi>All</hi> they, and <hi>Only</hi> they, both comprehended in this word, <hi>[All] All that my Father giveth me ſhall come unto me.</hi>

Such Jeſus Chriſt came to ſeek. And being in Heaven, he hath now an eye to them, ſuch among them as are given unto him. Whileſt they do not ſeek after him, yet he ſeeketh after them, <hi>drawing</hi> them to himſelf. This doth <hi>God the Father,</hi> (as you have heard.) And thus alſo doth <hi>Chriſt. When I am lift up</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will draw all men unto me,</hi> John 12.32. Chriſt being lift up, firſt upon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> then upon the <hi>Throne,</hi> ſet at the right hand of his Father, he then ſaith he would <hi>draw all men</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

But now under the <hi>Gospel</hi> he doth it more vigorouſly than ever, by ſetting up his <hi>Standard,</hi> holding forth himſelf in the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel, and withall ſending forth his <hi>Spirit,</hi> which accompanying the Word, maketh it effectual. Thus is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> to the <hi>Iron,</hi> by a ſecret vertue, the vertue of his Spirit attracting his Elect
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170465:189"/> people; who being thus drawn by him, do now willingly come unto him. <hi>Draw me, and we will run after thee</hi> (ſaith the Church unto Chriſt, <hi>Cant,</hi> 1.4. promiſing a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all her members to follow him upon his putting forth his effectual power in them.)

Juſt is it with God to withhold his grace from thoſe who thus reject it, and to harden their hearts, confirming them in their infidelity, who have firſt hardened their own hearts againſt the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of grace and mercy in Chriſt. This is that which our Evangeliſt St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> John 12.37. <hi>Though Chriſt had done ſo many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him.</hi> And why not? how came they to be ſo ſtupid? The reaſon is rendered, <hi>v.</hi> 39, 40. <hi>Therefore they could not believe, becauſe Iſaias ſaid, He hath blinded their eyes, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened their hearts,</hi> &amp;c. They had firſt wilfully ſhut their own eyes againſt the light of the Goſpel, maliciouſly withſtanding and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt. And thereupon God in his moſt juſt and righteous judgment giveth them over to a reprobate ſenſe, taking from them thoſe abilities which they had of believing unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. O take heed that the like do not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to any of you! which you may juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, ſhall you dare upon this, or any other pretence whatever, to reject and refuſe the gracious offers of Chriſt tendred to you.</p>

                  <p>So was it with thoſe who came to him in the dayes of his fleſh for the cure of their bodily infirmities, we do not read that he refuſed, that he rejected any of them, or that he ſent

And the like may they expect who come unto him upon a ſpiritual account, for the cure of their ſoul-maladies, for the taking away the guilt and power of ſin, and for the obtaining of eternal ſalvation by him, he will not reject them. However he may for a time, for the like exerciſe of their faith, hold them off, yet he will not <hi>caſt them out;</hi> he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, he will embrace them.</p>

                     </note> whatever God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them not to caſt it out in ſuch a way. True indeed (as the ſame <hi>Author</hi> further no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) there is ſuch a uſe which may lawfully and warrantably be made of theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> that thoſe to whom God giveth eſtates, they are not to caſt them out by prodigal and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſpending and ſquandring of them, but in a provident way to preſerve them; yet in the mean time, what God calleth for, either for pious or charitable uſes, let them not be unwilling to part with. So was <hi>Abraham</hi> with his <hi>ſon,</hi> whom God had given to him, yet he was not unwilling to give him to him again. In like manner are Chriſtians to deal with their eſtates; where God calleth for them, they are not to withold them; ſo reſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with, and thankful for their fathers portion.</p>
                  <p>Yea, though happily it be not every wayes anſwerable to what they could deſire. It was a weakneſs in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who in the want of one bleſſing (a <hi>Son</hi>) ſeemed to ſlight all other mercies. When the Lord by way of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement ſaid unto him, <hi>Fear not Abram, I am thy ſhield, and thy exceeding great reward,</hi> he preſently and paſſionately replies, <hi>Lord God, what wilt thou give me, ſeeing I go child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs?</hi> Gen. 15.1, 2. Let there not be the like murmuring or repining thought in any of the Lords people. In the want of ſome one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired mercy, let them not caſt out all others by a ſlighting and undervaluing of what they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170465:213"/> have received. What they have, let them know it is that which their <hi>Father hath given them;</hi> and ſo looking upon it as their <hi>fathers portion,</hi> let them receive it contentedly, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Chriſtians to comply with Gods will in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</note>And what they do as to <hi>mercies,</hi> let them do the like alſo as to <hi>Croſſes</hi> and <hi>Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> taking notice that whatever their Afflictions be, they are no other than what their <hi>Father hath given them,</hi> layed out for them, let them quietly ſubmit to them. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo hath their bleſſed <hi>Lord and Saviour</hi> ſet them a pattern, who, however he depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated that <hi>bitter cup</hi> which he ſaw coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, praying again and again that it might <hi>paſſe from him,</hi> yet ſtill he reſolves his will into the will of his Father, <hi>Nevertheleſſe not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> Math. 26.39.

And herein let him be a pattern for us, every of us. Looking upon every <hi>Cup</hi> of affliction which is put into our hands, as the <hi>Cup which our Father hath given to us,</hi> let us not caſt it out nor refuſe to drink it. Not ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by any indirect and unlawful wayes and meanes to ſhut out, or ſhake off whatever trials the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to exerciſe us with, but quietly and contentedly ſubmit to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170465:213"/> his diſpenſations, both in regard of the kind, and meaſure and continuance, not chooſing our own rod, but in all ſubmitting to the will of our heavenly Father: Thus ſuffering in an <hi>obediential way,</hi> as our bleſſed Saviour did, now may we comfortably expect the like iſſue that he had, even a gracious ſupportation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and a happy deliverance out of it.</p>
